# [Project 1: Egypt VS saudi World Cup 2018 Data analysis](https://github.com/Jrkasem/AK_healtcare_data_portfolio/blob/main/Soccer%20Game%20data%20analysis%20.ipynb)
This GitHub project is an advanced football (soccer) match data analysis tool that utilizes Python for in-depth statistical and visual examination of match events. The core of this project lies in its integration with the statsbombpy library, which enables the retrieval of detailed match data from StatsBomb, a renowned data provider in the world of football analytics. The project is structured to efficiently process this data, focusing on a specific team's performance in a given match. It meticulously organizes and filters the data, preparing it for various types of analysis. This includes isolating events like shots, passes, fouls, and player-specific actions, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the match.

The visualization aspect of the project is where it truly stands out. Leveraging the mplsoccer library, the tool creates a series of intuitive and informative plots that bring the match data to life. These include pitch maps that illustrate shot locations and outcomes, differentiating between goals and missed shots with color-coded markers. It also visualizes passing networks, showcasing the direction and end locations of passes with clear, directed arrows. The project extends its capabilities to generate time-based event distributions, pie charts for shot outcomes, player influence metrics through bar charts, and heat maps depicting player movements and defensive actions. These visualizations are not only valuable for post-match analysis but also offer potential for real-time insights, making the tool an invaluable resource for coaches, analysts, and football enthusiasts who seek a deeper understanding of the game's nuances.
